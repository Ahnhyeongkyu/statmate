I just launched StatMate -- a free statistics calculator that auto-formats your results into APA 7th edition tables.

20 tests. One click. Publication-ready output.

https://statmate.org

🧵 Here's what it does:

What's included:

• t-tests (independent, paired, one-sample)
• ANOVA (one-way, two-way, repeated measures)
• Chi-square & Fisher's exact
• Correlation & regression (simple, multiple, logistic)
• Nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis, Friedman)
• Factor analysis & Cronbach's alpha

The APA 7th auto-formatting is the key feature:

• Properly formatted results tables with italics, decimal places, and APA structure
• Effect sizes (Cohen's d, eta-squared, Cramer's V, etc.)
• Confidence intervals
• Assumption checks (normality, homogeneity)

Export to Word or PDF in one click.

• All computation happens in your browser
• Your data never leaves your computer
• No account required for free features
• No data uploaded to any server

Cross-validated against R 4.3 for accuracy.

Available in English, Korean, and Japanese.

Thread 2: Problem/Solution Angle
==========================================

I was tired of manually formatting APA tables.

Every time I ran a t-test or ANOVA, I'd spend another hour making sure the table had the right italics, decimal places, and structure.

So I built a tool that does it automatically.

The workflow used to be:

1. Run analysis in SPSS/R
2. Copy numbers into Word
3. Manually format the APA table
4. Triple-check every decimal, every italic, every symbol
5. Reviewer finds a mistake anyway

Time spent on formatting: 2-3 hours per table.

The workflow with StatMate:

1. Paste your data
2. Click "Calculate"
3. Get an APA 7th formatted table with effect sizes, CIs, and assumption checks
4. Export to Word or PDF

Time spent: about 30 seconds.

Thread 3: Technical Angle
==========================================

[Tweet 1/4]
Built a stats calculator that runs entirely in your browser -- no server, no data upload, no backend computation.

Here's the technical breakdown:

🧵

Stack:

• Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
• All 20 statistical tests implemented in pure client-side JavaScript
• No Python/R backend -- computations happen in the browser
• Deployed on Vercel

Why client-side? Privacy. Research data should never touch someone else's server.

Accuracy matters when you're doing statistics in JS:

• Cross-validated every calculator against R 4.3 output
• Welch's t-test by default (not Student's)
• Shapiro-Wilk for normality, Levene's for homogeneity
• Post-hoc tests: Bonferroni, Dunn's, Nemenyi

Validation results: https://statmate.org/validation

The hardest part wasn't the statistics. It was generating pixel-perfect APA 7th tables that researchers would actually trust.

Effect sizes, confidence intervals, assumption flags -- all formatted to spec.
