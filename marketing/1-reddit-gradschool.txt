I made a free statistics calculator that auto-formats results in APA 7th edition -- hoping it helps other grad students

Hey everyone,

Like many of you, I spent way too much time during my thesis manually formatting statistical results into APA tables. Every single time I ran a t-test or ANOVA, I'd spend another hour or two making sure the table looked right, checking italics, decimal places, and all the little details reviewers love to nitpick.

So I built StatMate -- a free, web-based statistics calculator that does 20 common analyses (t-test, ANOVA, chi-square, correlation, regression, and more) and **automatically generates properly formatted APA 7th edition results tables**.

Here's what it does:

- Runs your analysis and gives you an APA-formatted table you can copy or export to Word/PDF
- Includes effect sizes, confidence intervals, and assumption checks
- Works entirely in your browser -- your data never leaves your computer, nothing is uploaded to any server
- No account needed, no installation, completely free
- Available in English, Korean, and Japanese

The APA auto-formatting is the part I'm most proud of. I couldn't find any existing tool that did this well, and it was always the most tedious part of writing my results section.

You can try it here: https://statmate.org

I'd genuinely appreciate any feedback. I built this to solve my own problem and I'm hoping it's useful for others in the same boat. If there's an analysis you wish it had, let me know.

Good luck to everyone in thesis season!
