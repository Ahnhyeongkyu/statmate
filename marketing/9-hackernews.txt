I built a free, browser-based statistics calculator that runs 20 common tests and auto-generates APA 7th edition formatted results tables.

The problem: as a grad student, I spent hours manually formatting statistical results into APA tables after every analysis. Existing tools either cost hundreds of dollars (SPSS) or require you to format output yourself (R, Python).

What StatMate does:

- 20 calculators: t-tests, ANOVA (one-way, two-way, repeated measures), chi-square, correlation, regression (simple, multiple, logistic), factor analysis, nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis, Friedman), Cronbach's alpha, and more
- Outputs APA 7th edition tables with effect sizes, CIs, and assumption checks built in
- Export to Word (.docx) or PDF in one click
- All computation happens client-side in JavaScript -- no data leaves the browser, nothing is uploaded
- Cross-validated against R 4.3 for numerical accuracy (validation page: https://statmate.org/validation)
- Trilingual UI (English, Korean, Japanese)

Stack: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, deployed on Vercel. Statistical computations are pure JS with no server dependency.

Pro tier ($5.99/mo) adds AI-powered result interpretation via Claude and Word export. All 20 calculators and PDF export are free.

Would appreciate feedback, especially on numerical edge cases or missing tests.
