Hey IH! 👋

I'm launching StatMate today -- a free, web-based statistics calculator with 20 tests and automatic APA 7th edition table formatting. Here's the story.

## The Problem

I was a grad student writing my thesis and spending an absurd amount of time on one thing: formatting statistical results into APA tables. Every t-test, every ANOVA -- run the analysis, then spend another hour or two making the table look right. I looked for a tool that would just give me a properly formatted table and couldn't find one that wasn't either $500+ (SPSS) or required coding knowledge (R).

## The Solution

I built StatMate (https://statmate.org) -- paste your data, pick a test, get a publication-ready APA 7th table with effect sizes, confidence intervals, and assumption checks. Export to Word or PDF. Done.

## What I Built

- **20 statistical calculators** (t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square, regression, nonparametric tests, factor analysis, etc.)
- **APA 7th auto-formatting** -- this is the core feature and what makes it different
- **Privacy-first** -- all computations run client-side in JavaScript, no data uploaded
- **3 languages** -- English, Korean, Japanese
- **Cross-validated against R** for accuracy

## Tech Stack

- Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Deployed on Vercel (free tier works fine for now)
- Statistical computations are pure client-side JS
- No database needed for the core product (Supabase for optional auth/history)

## Monetization

Using **Lemon Squeezy** for payments. Setup was surprisingly smooth -- took about a day to integrate checkout, license validation, and activation.

- **Free tier**: All 20 calculators, APA tables, PDF export, clipboard copy
- **Pro** ($5.99/mo or $49.99/yr): AI-powered result interpretation (Claude API), Word export, ad-free, analysis history
- **Student discount**: 50% off with .edu/.ac.kr email
- **Credit packs**: For one-time users who don't want a subscription

I also have two B2B offerings in early stages:
- Expert Review service (human statistician reviews your analysis)
- University License (institutional access)

## Current Status

Launched today. No revenue yet (obviously), but the product is feature-complete with all 4 sprints done. Now it's all about distribution.

## What I'd Love Feedback On

1. Pricing -- is $5.99/mo reasonable for the Pro features?
2. Landing page conversion -- does statmate.org communicate the value clearly?
3. Distribution channels -- what worked for you when launching dev/research tools?

Thanks for reading. Happy to answer any questions about the build, stack, or monetization approach.
