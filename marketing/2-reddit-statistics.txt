Hi r/statistics,

I've been working on a free, open web tool called StatMate that provides 20 commonly used statistical calculators with a focus on correctness and usable output.

**What's included:**

- Independent & paired samples t-tests (Welch's t-test by default, with option for Student's)
- One-way & two-way ANOVA (with post-hoc tests)
- Chi-square test of independence and goodness of fit
- Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall correlations
- Simple and multiple linear regression
- Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon signed-rank, Kruskal-Wallis
- Descriptive statistics and normality tests

**What makes it different from other online calculators:**

1. **Assumption checks are built in** -- normality (Shapiro-Wilk), homogeneity of variance (Levene's), and the tool flags violations with recommendations
2. **Effect sizes reported by default** -- Cohen's d, eta-squared, partial eta-squared, Cramer's V, etc., depending on the test
3. **APA 7th edition formatted output** -- generates publication-ready results tables that you can export to Word or PDF
4. **All computations run client-side** in JavaScript -- your data never touches a server. The underlying calculations have been cross-validated against R output to ensure accuracy
5. **Confidence intervals** included where applicable

It's aimed at researchers and grad students who need quick, reliable analyses with properly formatted output. It's not meant to replace R or Python for complex analyses, but for standard tests it should save a lot of time, especially on the reporting side.
