## Introduction

Linear regression is the workhorse of statistical analysis. At its simplest, **simple linear regression** uses one predictor to explain variation in an outcome. **Multiple regression** extends this framework to two or more predictors, allowing you to model complex relationships and control for confounding variables.

But more predictors do not always mean a better model. Adding irrelevant variables increases complexity, can introduce multicollinearity, and may reduce predictive accuracy on new data. This article explains when to use each approach, how to compare them, and how to avoid common pitfalls.

Whether you are modeling the relationship between study hours and exam scores or building a comprehensive model of housing prices, understanding the tradeoff between simplicity and complexity is essential. Run your own analysis with our [Simple Regression Calculator](/calculators/simple-regression) or [Multiple Regression Calculator](/calculators/multiple-regression).

## When to Use Simple Linear Regression

Simple regression is appropriate when:

1. **You have one predictor variable** and want to understand its relationship with the outcome.

2. **Exploratory analysis.** You are investigating whether a single factor is associated with the outcome before building a larger model.

3. **The predictor is the only relevant variable.** In controlled experiments where other factors are held constant, a single predictor may suffice.

4. **Communication and simplicity are priorities.** A model with one predictor is easy to explain, visualize, and present to non-technical audiences.

5. **Sample size is small.** With limited data, multiple regression is prone to overfitting. The general rule of thumb is at least 10-20 observations per predictor.

## When to Use Multiple Regression

Multiple regression is appropriate when:

1. **Multiple factors influence the outcome.** Most real-world phenomena are determined by several variables. Including relevant predictors improves both understanding and prediction.

2. **You need to control for confounders.** If age and income both affect health spending, a simple regression of income on spending is confounded by age. Multiple regression separates their effects.

3. **You want to compare the relative importance of predictors.** Standardized coefficients (beta weights) in multiple regression reveal which predictors have the strongest association.

4. **You are building a predictive model.** More predictors (when relevant) typically improve prediction, provided the model is not overfit.

5. **You have adequate sample size.** A minimum of 10-20 observations per predictor ensures stable estimates.

## Example Dataset

A real estate analyst wants to predict house sale prices. The dataset contains 20 houses with three potential predictors: square footage, number of bedrooms, and distance to the nearest school (in miles).

| House | Sq Ft  | Bedrooms | Distance (mi) | Sale Price ($K) |
|-------|--------|----------|----------------|-----------------|

### Descriptive Statistics

| Variable       | Mean    | SD      | Min    | Max    |
|---------------|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| Sq Ft         | 1,780   | 438.7   | 1,100  | 2,600  |
| Bedrooms      | 3.15    | 0.93    | 2      | 5      |
| Distance (mi) | 1.16    | 0.63    | 0.3    | 2.5    |
| Price ($K)     | 304.0   | 63.5    | 190    | 420    |

## Simple Regression: Price vs Square Footage

### Model

Price = b0 + b1 * SqFt

### Results

| Parameter  | Estimate | Std. Error | t-value | p-value |
|-----------|----------|------------|---------|---------|
| Intercept | 42.53    | 18.72      | 2.27    | 0.036   |
| Sq Ft     | 0.147    | 0.010      | 14.27   | < 0.001 |

### Model Fit

| Metric          | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| R-squared       | 0.919 |
| Adjusted R-sq   | 0.914 |
| Std. Error (RSE)| 18.61 |
| F-statistic     | 203.6 (df: 1, 18) |
| p-value (model) | < 0.001 |

**Interpretation:** For every additional square foot, the predicted sale price increases by $147. Square footage alone explains 91.9% of the variation in sale prices. The model is highly significant.

### Equation

Price ($K) = 42.53 + 0.147 * SqFt

A 2,000 sq ft house would be predicted to sell for: 42.53 + 0.147 * 2000 = $336.5K.

## Multiple Regression: All Three Predictors

### Model

Price = b0 + b1 * SqFt + b2 * Bedrooms + b3 * Distance

### Results

| Parameter  | Estimate | Std. Error | t-value | p-value |
|-----------|----------|------------|---------|---------|
| Intercept | 55.21    | 16.45      | 3.36    | 0.004   |
| Sq Ft     | 0.112    | 0.015      | 7.47    | < 0.001 |
| Bedrooms  | 15.83    | 7.92       | 2.00    | 0.063   |
| Distance  | -18.47   | 5.31       | -3.48   | 0.003   |

### Model Fit

| Metric           | Value |
|-----------------|-------|
| R-squared        | 0.963 |
| Adjusted R-sq    | 0.956 |
| Std. Error (RSE) | 13.35 |
| F-statistic      | 138.9 (df: 3, 16) |
| p-value (model)  | < 0.001 |

**Interpretation:**
- **Sq Ft (b1 = 0.112):** Each additional square foot increases the price by $112, holding bedrooms and distance constant. This is lower than in the simple model (0.147) because some of the effect attributed to square footage is now shared with bedrooms.
- **Bedrooms (b2 = 15.83, p = 0.063):** Each additional bedroom adds $15,830 to the predicted price, but this effect is not statistically significant at the 0.05 level.
- **Distance (b3 = -18.47, p = 0.003):** Each additional mile from a school reduces the price by $18,470. This is significant and practically meaningful.

## Comparing the Two Models

| Metric            | Simple (SqFt only) | Multiple (3 predictors) |
|------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| R-squared         | 0.919               | 0.963                    |
| Adjusted R-sq     | 0.914               | 0.956                    |
| RSE              | 18.61               | 13.35                    |
| AIC              | 176.4               | 163.8                    |
| BIC              | 179.4               | 169.8                    |
| Predictors sig.  | 1/1                  | 2/3                      |

The multiple regression model improves over the simple model:
- Adjusted R-squared increases from 0.914 to 0.956.
- RSE decreases from 18.61 to 13.35 (predictions are more precise).
- AIC and BIC both decrease (lower is better).

Even though Bedrooms is not individually significant (p = 0.063), the overall model improvement justifies including all three predictors. However, a parsimonious modeler might drop Bedrooms and keep only SqFt and Distance.

### Reduced Model: SqFt + Distance

| Parameter  | Estimate | Std. Error | t-value | p-value |
|-----------|----------|------------|---------|---------|
| Intercept | 72.18    | 14.23      | 5.07    | < 0.001 |
| Sq Ft     | 0.131    | 0.009      | 14.56   | < 0.001 |
| Distance  | -20.91   | 5.12       | -4.08   | < 0.001 |

| Metric          | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| R-squared       | 0.955 |
| Adjusted R-sq   | 0.950 |
| RSE            | 14.22 |
| AIC            | 166.1 |
| BIC            | 170.1 |

This two-predictor model is a strong compromise: it explains nearly as much variance as the three-predictor model (Adj R-sq = 0.950 vs 0.956) while being simpler and having all predictors significant.

## Understanding Multicollinearity

### What Is Multicollinearity?

Multicollinearity occurs when predictor variables are highly correlated with each other. This does not violate the core assumptions of regression, but it:

- Inflates standard errors of coefficients.
- Makes individual predictors appear non-significant even when the overall model fits well.
- Makes coefficients unstable (small changes in data lead to large changes in estimates).

### Correlation Matrix

|              | Sq Ft  | Bedrooms | Distance |
|-------------|--------|----------|----------|
| Sq Ft       | 1.000  | 0.912    | -0.287   |
| Bedrooms    | 0.912  | 1.000    | -0.235   |
| Distance    | -0.287 | -0.235   | 1.000    |

Square footage and bedrooms are highly correlated (r = 0.912). This explains why Bedrooms was not significant in the multiple regression model: its information largely overlaps with SqFt.

### Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)

| Predictor  | VIF   |
|-----------|-------|
| Sq Ft     | 5.82  |
| Bedrooms  | 5.41  |
| Distance  | 1.13  |

VIF values above 5 suggest moderate multicollinearity between SqFt and Bedrooms. Values above 10 indicate severe problems. In our case, the VIFs for SqFt and Bedrooms are concerning but not extreme.

### Solutions for Multicollinearity

1. **Remove one correlated predictor.** If SqFt and Bedrooms are highly correlated, keep the one that is more theoretically relevant or has stronger predictive power.

2. **Create a composite variable.** Combine correlated predictors (e.g., a "house size index" from SqFt and Bedrooms).

3. **Use regularization.** Ridge regression and LASSO can handle multicollinearity by shrinking coefficients.

4. **Center or standardize variables.** This does not eliminate multicollinearity but can help with interaction terms.

## Model Selection Strategies

### Forward Selection

Start with no predictors. Add the one with the lowest p-value (if below a threshold). Continue adding until no remaining predictor improves the model.

### Backward Elimination

Start with all predictors. Remove the one with the highest p-value (if above a threshold). Continue until all remaining predictors are significant.

### Stepwise Selection

Combine forward and backward approaches. At each step, add or remove predictors based on criteria like AIC.

### Information Criteria Comparison

| Model                     | AIC    | BIC    | Adj R-sq |
|--------------------------|--------|--------|----------|
| SqFt only                | 176.4  | 179.4  | 0.914    |
| Bedrooms only            | 180.2  | 183.2  | 0.892    |
| Distance only            | 198.7  | 201.7  | 0.682    |
| SqFt + Distance          | 166.1  | 170.1  | 0.950    |
| SqFt + Bedrooms          | 175.8  | 179.8  | 0.917    |
| Bedrooms + Distance      | 172.4  | 176.4  | 0.928    |
| SqFt + Bedrooms + Dist   | 163.8  | 169.8  | 0.956    |

The full model (AIC = 163.8) and the SqFt + Distance model (AIC = 166.1) are the top two candidates. The difference in AIC is 2.3, which is modest. Many analysts would prefer the simpler two-predictor model.

## Key Differences in Interpretation

### Simple Regression Coefficient

In simple regression, the coefficient for SqFt (0.147) represents the **total** association between square footage and price, including any indirect effects through correlated variables like bedrooms.

### Multiple Regression Coefficient

In multiple regression, the coefficient for SqFt (0.112) represents the **partial** association: the effect of square footage on price, holding bedrooms and distance constant. This is often the more meaningful quantity when you want to isolate individual effects.

### Standardized Coefficients (Beta Weights)

To compare the relative importance of predictors in multiple regression, use standardized coefficients:

| Predictor  | Unstandardized B | Standardized Beta | Rank |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|------|
| Sq Ft     | 0.112            | 0.775             | 1    |
| Bedrooms  | 15.83            | 0.232             | 3    |
| Distance  | -18.47           | -0.183            | 2    |

Square footage has the largest standardized effect (Beta = 0.775), followed by distance (Beta = -0.183) and bedrooms (Beta = 0.232 but not significant).

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Adding predictors to increase R-squared.** R-squared never decreases when you add predictors, even irrelevant ones. Always use **adjusted R-squared** or information criteria (AIC/BIC) instead.

2. **Ignoring multicollinearity.** High VIFs make coefficients unreliable. Check VIFs before interpreting individual predictors.

3. **Overfitting with too many predictors.** With 20 observations and 10 predictors, your model will fit the training data well but generalize poorly. Maintain at least a 10:1 ratio of observations to predictors.

4. **Confusing correlation with causation.** Regression identifies associations, not causal relationships. The coefficient for distance does not prove that moving closer to a school increases house prices.

5. **Not checking residual assumptions.** Both simple and multiple regression assume linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals. Plot residuals vs fitted values to check.

## FAQ

### How do I decide how many predictors to include?

Use a combination of **theory, adjusted R-squared, and information criteria (AIC/BIC)**. Include predictors that are theoretically relevant and improve model fit. Remove predictors that are non-significant and do not improve AIC/BIC. The 10:1 rule (10 observations per predictor) provides a practical upper limit.

### What is the difference between R-squared and adjusted R-squared?

**R-squared** always increases (or stays the same) when you add a predictor, regardless of whether it is useful. **Adjusted R-squared** penalizes for the number of predictors. It increases only if the new predictor improves the model more than expected by chance. Always report adjusted R-squared when comparing models with different numbers of predictors.

### Can I mix continuous and categorical predictors in multiple regression?

Yes. Categorical predictors are included using **dummy variables** (also called indicator variables). A categorical variable with k categories requires k-1 dummy variables. For example, a variable with levels "low," "medium," and "high" would be represented by two dummy variables.

### What is the difference between multiple regression and multivariate regression?

**Multiple regression** has one outcome variable and multiple predictors. **Multivariate regression** has multiple outcome variables. The terms are often confused. Most researchers mean "multiple regression" when they say "multivariate regression."

### How do I check for non-linear relationships?

Plot each predictor against the outcome and against the residuals. Curved patterns suggest non-linearity. Solutions include adding polynomial terms (X-squared), using log transformations, or fitting generalized additive models (GAMs).

### Should I standardize my predictors before running multiple regression?

Standardizing (converting to z-scores) is not required for valid estimation but is useful for:
- Comparing the relative importance of predictors (via standardized betas).
- Reducing numerical issues when predictors are on very different scales.
- Interpreting interaction terms more easily.

The significance tests and R-squared values are identical whether you standardize or not.

### What is suppression in multiple regression?

A **suppressor variable** is a predictor that increases the predictive validity of other variables when included in the model, even though it may have a weak direct correlation with the outcome. This can cause coefficients to change sign or magnitude when moving from simple to multiple regression. While interesting, suppression can make interpretation challenging and should be investigated carefully.
