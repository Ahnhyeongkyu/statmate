## When Parametric Tests Fall Short

Parametric tests like the t-test and ANOVA are powerful tools, but they come with assumptions: normally distributed data, interval or ratio measurement scales, and homogeneity of variances. When your data violate these assumptions, nonparametric tests provide robust alternatives that make fewer distributional assumptions.

This guide helps you decide which nonparametric test to use and when it is the right choice over its parametric counterpart.

## The Parametric vs. Nonparametric Decision

The key question is not whether your data are perfectly normal, but whether assumption violations are severe enough to invalidate parametric results. Consider nonparametric tests when:

- **Small sample sizes** (n less than 30 per group) make normality hard to assess
- **Ordinal data** such as Likert scales or rankings
- **Severe skewness** or heavy outliers that resist transformation
- **Non-normal distributions** confirmed by Shapiro-Wilk test (p less than .05)

## Choosing the Right Nonparametric Test

| Research Question | Parametric | Nonparametric |
|---|---|---|
| Compare 2 independent groups | Independent t-test | Mann-Whitney U |
| Compare 2 paired/matched groups | Paired t-test | Wilcoxon signed-rank |
| Compare 3+ independent groups | One-way ANOVA | Kruskal-Wallis H |
| Compare 3+ related conditions | Repeated measures ANOVA | Friedman test |

## Mann-Whitney U Test

Use this when comparing two independent groups on an ordinal or non-normal continuous variable. The test compares the rank distributions of the two groups.

**APA format example:**
A Mann-Whitney U test indicated that satisfaction scores were significantly higher for Group A (Mdn = 4.50) than Group B (Mdn = 3.00), U = 45.00, p = .012, r = .38.

## Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test

The paired equivalent of Mann-Whitney. Use this for before-after comparisons or matched pairs when the difference scores are non-normal.

**APA format example:**
A Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed a significant increase in scores from pre-test (Mdn = 65) to post-test (Mdn = 78), T = 12.00, p = .003, r = .52.

## Kruskal-Wallis H Test

The nonparametric alternative to one-way ANOVA. Use this when comparing three or more independent groups.

**APA format example:**
A Kruskal-Wallis H test showed a significant difference in performance across teaching methods, H(2) = 12.45, p = .002, eta-squared = .15.

Follow up with Dunn's post-hoc test with Bonferroni correction to identify which groups differ.

## Friedman Test

Use this for repeated measures designs with three or more conditions when the normality assumption is violated.

**APA format example:**
A Friedman test indicated a significant difference across the four time points, chi-square(3) = 18.60, p less than .001, W = .62.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Do not default to nonparametric tests out of caution.** When assumptions are met, parametric tests have more statistical power.
2. **Check effect sizes.** Nonparametric tests have their own effect size measures (r for Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon, eta-squared for Kruskal-Wallis, Kendall's W for Friedman).
3. **Report medians, not means.** When using nonparametric tests, report medians and interquartile ranges rather than means and standard deviations.
