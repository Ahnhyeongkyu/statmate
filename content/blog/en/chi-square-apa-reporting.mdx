## The Basics of Chi-Square APA Reporting

The chi-square test is one of the most frequently used statistical tests in social sciences, yet many researchers struggle with its proper APA formatting. Whether you are running a test of independence or a goodness-of-fit test, this guide covers the exact format you need.

## Chi-Square Test of Independence

The test of independence examines whether two categorical variables are related. The APA format includes the chi-square value, degrees of freedom, sample size, p-value, and an effect size measure.

**APA template:**
chi-square(df, N = sample size) = X.XX, p = .XXX, V = X.XX

**Example:**
A chi-square test of independence was performed to examine the relationship between gender and career choice. The relation between these variables was significant, chi-square(2, N = 180) = 9.87, p = .007, V = .23.

### Key Components

1. **chi-square statistic** with degrees of freedom in parentheses
2. **N** (total sample size) included in the parentheses
3. **Exact p-value** (or "p less than .001" for very small values)
4. **Effect size**: Cramer's V for larger tables, phi for 2x2 tables

## Goodness-of-Fit Test

The goodness-of-fit test checks whether observed frequencies match expected frequencies for a single categorical variable.

**Example:**
A chi-square goodness-of-fit test indicated that preference for the three menu options was not equally distributed, chi-square(2, N = 120) = 14.30, p less than .001.

## Fisher's Exact Test

When expected cell counts are below 5, report Fisher's exact test instead of chi-square. This is common with small samples.

**Example:**
Fisher's exact test indicated a significant association between treatment type and recovery status, p = .023, OR = 3.50, 95% CI [1.15, 10.67].

## Reporting Crosstabulation Tables

Always include a contingency table showing observed (and optionally expected) frequencies. APA recommends presenting percentages alongside raw counts to aid interpretation.

## Common Reporting Mistakes

1. **Forgetting N.** Always include the total sample size in the chi-square reporting format.
2. **Using chi-square with small expected counts.** If any expected frequency is below 5, use Fisher's exact test.
3. **Omitting effect size.** Many journals now require Cramer's V or phi alongside chi-square results.
4. **Reporting only significance.** Describe the pattern of results, not just whether the test was significant.
