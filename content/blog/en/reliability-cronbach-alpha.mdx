## What Is Reliability and Why Does It Matter?

Before you can draw meaningful conclusions from a survey, questionnaire, or psychological scale, you need to establish that the instrument measures something *consistently*. That is what reliability is about. If a bathroom scale shows a different weight every time you step on it within the same minute, it is unreliable, and any measurement you take from it is essentially useless.

In research, reliability refers to the degree to which a measurement instrument produces stable and consistent results. A scale with high reliability yields similar scores under consistent conditions. Without reliability, validity is impossible: an instrument cannot measure the right thing if it cannot measure anything consistently.

## Types of Reliability

Reliability is not a single concept. Different types capture different aspects of consistency.

- **Test-retest reliability** measures stability over time. The same test is administered to the same group on two occasions, and the correlation between scores is computed. High test-retest reliability means the instrument produces similar results across time points.

- **Inter-rater reliability** assesses agreement between different raters or observers scoring the same phenomenon. This is critical in studies involving subjective judgment, such as behavioral coding or clinical diagnosis.

- **Internal consistency** evaluates whether items within a single scale or subscale measure the same underlying construct. If a 10-item anxiety questionnaire is internally consistent, a person with high anxiety should score high on most of the items, not just a few.

- **Split-half reliability** is a specific method for assessing internal consistency. The items are divided into two halves (e.g., odd-numbered vs. even-numbered items), and the correlation between the two half-scores is computed. Because splitting a test in half reduces its length, the raw correlation underestimates the reliability of the full test. This is where the **Spearman-Brown prophecy formula** comes in: it corrects the split-half correlation to estimate what the reliability would be for the full-length test.

Among these, **internal consistency** is the most frequently reported form of reliability in social science research, and **Cronbach's alpha** is its most widely used measure.

## Cronbach's Alpha — The Intuition Behind the Formula

Cronbach's alpha (*alpha*) was introduced by Lee Cronbach in 1951 and remains the default reliability coefficient in most fields. The formula is:

*alpha* = (*k* / (*k* - 1)) x (1 - (sum of item variances / total score variance))

Where *k* is the number of items. The intuition is straightforward: if the items in a scale all measure the same construct, they should covary with each other. When items covary strongly, the sum of individual item variances will be small relative to the total score variance, pushing alpha closer to 1. When items are unrelated, each item's variance accounts for a large portion of the total, and alpha drops toward 0.

In essence, alpha asks: "How much of the total score variance is due to the common factor shared by all items, rather than item-specific noise?"

## Interpreting Cronbach's Alpha

The following benchmarks, originally proposed by George and Mallery (2003) and widely adopted in the literature, provide general guidance:

| Alpha Value | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| *alpha* ≥ .90 | Excellent |
| .80 ≤ *alpha* ≤ .89 | Good |
| .70 ≤ *alpha* ≤ .79 | Acceptable |
| .60 ≤ *alpha* ≤ .69 | Questionable |
| .50 ≤ *alpha* ≤ .59 | Poor |
| *alpha* ≤ .49 | Unacceptable |

For research purposes, an alpha of **.70 or above** is generally considered the minimum acceptable threshold. For high-stakes testing (e.g., clinical diagnostic tools), alphas of **.80 or .90** are preferred.

It is important to note that alpha can be *too high*. An alpha above .95 sometimes indicates item redundancy, meaning that several items are essentially asking the same question in slightly different words. This inflates reliability without adding meaningful measurement breadth.

## Item-Level Diagnostics

A single alpha value tells you about the scale as a whole, but it does not reveal which specific items may be dragging reliability down. Two key diagnostics help with this.

### Corrected Item-Total Correlations

The corrected item-total correlation measures how strongly each item correlates with the sum of all *other* items in the scale (excluding the item itself to avoid part-whole contamination). Items with low corrected item-total correlations (typically below .30) are not measuring the same construct as the rest of the scale and are candidates for removal or revision.

### Alpha-If-Item-Deleted

This diagnostic shows what the overall alpha would be if a specific item were removed from the scale. If deleting an item would *increase* the overall alpha, that item is likely weakening the scale's internal consistency. Conversely, if deleting an item would substantially *decrease* alpha, that item is a strong contributor.

By examining both metrics together, you can make informed decisions about which items to retain, revise, or remove during scale development or refinement.

## Reporting Reliability in APA Format

APA 7th edition recommends reporting internal consistency coefficients for all multi-item scales used in a study. The standard format is:

> The scale demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's *alpha* = .85).

If you are reporting reliability for multiple subscales, a table format works well:

| Subscale | Items | Cronbach's *alpha* |
|----------|-------|--------------------|
| Cognitive anxiety | 8 | .87 |
| Somatic anxiety | 6 | .82 |
| Self-confidence | 7 | .79 |

Always report the alpha value to **two decimal places** and do not include a leading zero (since alpha ranges from 0 to 1). However, some style guides permit the leading zero; check your target journal's preferences.

## Common Mistakes and Misconceptions

### Alpha Is Not Validity

This is perhaps the most critical misunderstanding. A high Cronbach's alpha tells you that items are internally consistent, but it says nothing about whether the scale measures what it is supposed to measure. A set of items about shoe size would have high internal consistency, but that does not make it a valid measure of intelligence. Reliability is a necessary condition for validity, but it is not sufficient.

### Alpha Is Sensitive to the Number of Items

The formula includes *k* (the number of items) in the numerator. All else being equal, adding more items to a scale will increase alpha mechanically. A 30-item scale can achieve alpha = .80 even with modest inter-item correlations. Always consider the number of items when interpreting alpha, and examine mean inter-item correlations as a complementary metric (ideal range: .15 to .50).

### Small Sample Sizes Produce Unstable Estimates

With fewer than 50 or so respondents, alpha estimates become highly variable and may not generalize to the broader population. Some methodologists recommend a minimum of 10 respondents per item as a rough guideline. If your sample is small, report confidence intervals around alpha to communicate the uncertainty in your estimate.

### Alpha Assumes Unidimensionality

Cronbach's alpha is most appropriate for scales that measure a single underlying construct. If your scale is multidimensional (e.g., it measures both cognitive and emotional aspects of anxiety), computing a single alpha across all items can be misleading. In such cases, compute alpha separately for each subscale, or consider using omega coefficients, which handle multidimensional structures more appropriately.

### Using Alpha with Binary or Ordinal Items

While Cronbach's alpha technically works with any item format, it was developed for continuous data. For dichotomous items (yes/no, true/false), the **Kuder-Richardson 20 (KR-20)** formula is mathematically equivalent to alpha and is sometimes preferred for clarity. For ordinal items with few response categories, ordinal alpha or polychoric-based reliability measures may be more appropriate.

## Try StatMate's Cronbach's Alpha Calculator

Computing Cronbach's alpha by hand, especially with item-level diagnostics, is tedious and error-prone. StatMate's Cronbach's Alpha calculator handles the entire analysis for you. Enter your item-level data, and StatMate instantly computes the overall alpha, corrected item-total correlations, alpha-if-item-deleted values, and mean inter-item correlations. The results are formatted for direct use in your manuscript, saving you time and reducing the risk of computational errors.
